# Keylogger App

## Description
This project was an exercise in demonstrating how easy it can be to code for a malicious keylogging tool. My research along with it was a valuable examination as to the vulnerabilities that developers commonly face when interacting with node modules. 

Only 58 lines of vanilla JavaScript is written to listen for and identify keystrokes. Once the data is retrieved, a bad actor can attempt to decipher usernames, passwords, and any other piece of information that the unwitting user entered while using a corrupted application or machine.

Creating a keylogger is as simple as adding an event listener that tracks key and/or button presses. Logs of everything a user types and clicks can be recorded, stored, and written to files. Anonymous proxy servers can be used to retrieve these files from their target's machine. 

I built a react app to demonstrate how a simple keylogger can retrieve data. I add one small JavaScript file and install a single dependency package. The "EmailJS" package is included to use their SMTP server to send emails containing the logged data. I setup a new gmail account that will send itself a message everytime a user types something within the app and then clicks their mouse or hits enter. In practice, the messages would contain every string of characters a user entered before submitting a form or field. 
While this is a simple design, it shows how a commonly used package can be utilized to enact a very serious invasion of people's property. 

### Discussion

While keyloggers are only considered the tip of the iceberg of threats to individuals whose machines have been targetted, it should be obvious how devastating these tools can be. Since the software is locally present, a hacker can listen directly for the information they desire without having to work around measures like HTTPS encryption when intercepting internet traffic.
As developers, it is important to realize how easy it is for simple software like a keylogger to make its way onto our devices. In fact, going through the daily habit of installing npm packages is one way that we open ourselves up to attack. We shouldn't make the mistake of overlooking how easy it can for bad actors to compromise an application's package dependency, insert that package into an application's build pipeline, and make it to deployment without any validation.

Common ways hackers access pre-vetted packages:
- Impersonating legitmate packages
- Taking over abondoned packages
- Attack through network vuleralbilities, like the direct hijacking of a package publisher's npm account

Once in a package and downloaded onto a machine, there are many ways the malicious script can get up and running; it's as easy as using a "preinstall" directive in the "package.json" file to execute, even before the actual installation process has begun.
While hackers aren't always able to spread malicious code to a large number of machines with each attack, 
Attacking packages that are frequently used as dependencies allows malicious code to propogate across networks. 

An interesting note is that much of the "malicious" code that is spread is initiated by individuals or entitities that claim no harm is intended. For example, "penetration tests" are often conducted to discover specific vulnerabilities or even just to examine how far the code can be spread.
